    <h1>GitHub Collaboration</h1>
    <p>Github is a great tool for collaboration as you can upload code, and then 
        have multiple people working on it at the same time. Through a process 
        called forking, another person can make their own branch of your project,
        clone it onto their computer, and work on it on their own time. When their
        code is ready, they push it to the repository (just like when making your 
        first commit) and then they make a pull request to ask you to intsert their 
        code.
